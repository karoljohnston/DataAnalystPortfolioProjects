Data Analyst Portfolio Project Repository 

This portfolio project is done by the help of @AlexTheAnalyst Youtube playlist link attached above for reference.
Tableau project was done with a different dataset in order for me to learn solving and using data on my own but still the same concept as Alex The Analyst.
This repository will hold all of the code and queries from the Portfolio Projects


Thank you Alex The Analyst for teaching these projects.
